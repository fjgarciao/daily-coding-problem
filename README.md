# Daily Coding Problem

This repo contains my solutions from *Daily Conding Problem* book and emails.

## Exercices from book

### Arrays

* 1.1 Product of all other elements
	* Implemented in Scala using division
	* Implemented in Scala without using division
	
* 1.3 Maximum Subarray Sum
    * Implemented in Scala with complexity 0(n)

## Exercices from emails

* Problem 1: Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
	* Implemented in Scala with complexity 0(n^2)
	* Implemented in Scala with complexity 0(n), using dynamic programming
